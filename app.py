This model was trained on the [Email Spam Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/purusinghvi/email-spam-classification-dataset) from Kaggle.  

### üìä Dataset Information
- **RangeIndex:** 83,448 entries (0 to 83,447)  
- **Columns (2):**  
  - `label` ‚Üí 83,448 non-null, `int64`  
  - `text` ‚Üí 83,448 non-null, `object`  
- **Memory usage:** ~1.3 MB  

**Label meaning:**  
- `1` ‚Üí Spam email (43,910 entries)  
- `0` ‚Üí Ham/legitimate email (39,538 entries)  

**Text column:**  
Contains the actual email message content used for classification.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
While the model achieves **high accuracy** on test data, it is **not a large-scale production model**.  
It may sometimes **predict wrongly** and should **not** be used for critical filtering tasks (like banking, security, or healthcare).  

This project is for **learning and demonstration purposes only**.
