This model was trained on the [Email Spam Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/purusinghvi/email-spam-classification-dataset) from Kaggle.  

While the model achieves **high accuracy** on test data, it is **not a large-scale production model**.  
It may sometimes **predict wrongly** and should **not** be used for critical filtering tasks (like banking, security, or healthcare).  

This project is for **learning and demonstration purposes only**.
